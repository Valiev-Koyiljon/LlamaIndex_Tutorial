Adopting them, however,\\ncomes with some difﬁculties.

E-Commerce\\n1) Introduction: Electronic commerce, commonly referred\\nto as e-commerce, is a way for conducting economic trans-\\nactions and create relationships between groups of people\\nand entities using digital information processes and electronic\\ncommunications [128]. Globally, this type of trade has experi-\\nenced substantial growth, particularly in the retail sector. The\\npreference for internet shopping, especially among younger\\nmillennials, is a prominent trend in consumer behaviour.\\nMobile devices have consequently taken over as the main\\nmethod for carrying out internet transactions [129]. Therefore,\\nit is crucial for e-commerce companies to give the customer\\nexperience in their mobile applications top priority. The pro-\\nvision of brief text summaries for titles and reviews is an\\nessential component of this. These summaries are essential\\nfor optimizing search results, helping consumers identify ap-\\npropriate items, and ultimately raising customer happiness in\\nthe online purchasing space [130].\\n2) Impact of GPT in E-Commerce Realms: The e-\\ncommerce sector could signiﬁcantly advance with the intro-\\nduction of GPTs. GPTs can be accessed by users or customers\\nand are intended to answer commonly asked questions and\\ngive in-depth details about many elements of the e-commerce\\nprocess, such as products, delivery, refunds, and more [107].\\nOne of the main beneﬁts of GPTs is their capacity for quick\\nresponses, which decreases the amount of time customers must\\nwait to hear back from businesses [131]. By taking care of an\\nimportant number of client inquiries, this function not only\\nincreases customer happiness but also lessens the workload\\non support workers. Customers will ultimately have a better\\npurchasing experience as a result of being able to quickly\\nacquire the information they require and interact with GPTs\\n[106].\\n• Proofreading: To improve the calibre and accuracy of\\nwritten content in e-commerce, GPTs can be used for\\nproofreading.

Lifestyle\\n1) Introduction: Lifestyle, the way of our living, is one\\nof the prominent areas most people in today’s digital era of\\nAI, are bound to and look for constant improvement. The\\n“modus vivendi” is a Latin expression that semantically means\\na way of living and should be understood in terms of values\\nand attitudes. These two terms manifest self, inﬂuenced by\\nfamily, society, and global media. Directly or indirectly, these\\ninﬂuence an individual’s lifestyle. Adopted from a sociological\\nperspective, an individual expresses oneself through different\\npractices, viz., eating ways, drinking behaviours, mode of\\ntravel, travelling places, costume designs, body-shaping cloth\\nto wear, media preferences, education choices, job preferences,\\nentertainment modes, managing leisure time, means of com-\\nmunication and so [152]. In all these practices, individuals\\nwould like to explore and learn about what, where, how, and\\nwhen factors for reading sustainable development [153]. The\\nconcept of lifestyle is all about “how one wants to live one’s\\nlife.” Consumerism is the act of purchasing artifacts for soci-\\netal status and is one of the thriving lifestyle factors.\\n---------------------\\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\\nQuery: Tell me about GPT\\nAnswer: ', source_nodes=[NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='35953853-8db1-430a-830c-d1077a28ec2d', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '20', 'file_name': 'GPT-paper.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\User\\\\Desktop\\\\LlamaIndex\\\\tutorials\\\\..\\\\data\\\\GPT-paper.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 3250309, 'creation_date': '2025-02-12', 'last_modified_date': '2025-01-21'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='cef74980-c03a-4818-b143-159d137471f3', node_type='4', metadata={'page_label': '20', 'file_name': 'GPT-paper.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\User\\\\Desktop\\\\LlamaIndex\\\\tutorials\\\\..\\\\data\\\\GPT-paper.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 3250309, 'creation_date': '2025-02-12', 'last_modified_date': '2025-01-21'}, hash='c52df6ca5e7c1feb28a206169e51460f8f4c5da0b68b27e990262281fbe19a44'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='c8d195db-2394-4ae4-9261-2dc0621409fc', node_type='1', metadata={'page_label': '20', 'file_name': 'GPT-paper.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\User\\\\Desktop\\\\LlamaIndex\\\\tutorials\\\\..\\\\data\\\\GPT-paper.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 3250309, 'creation_date': '2025-02-12', 'last_modified_date': '2025-01-21'}, hash='96522cf2343e1dfe6cedc40471fd6dfe0fda561860b738498cac92405bb208f7')}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='GPTs can offer real-time updates, effective route optimization,\\nand customized recommendations in the travel and transporta-\\ntion industries, enhancing the overall travel experience and\\nincreasing operational effectiveness.
