Hello! I’m Koyilbek from Uzbekistan, a passionate AI engineer dedicated to building intelligent systems and 
leveraging cuNng-edge technologies to solve real-world problems. With over three years of experience in diverse, 
hands-on projects, I bring a proven ability to tackle challenges and drive impacRul soluSons. I am deeply commiTed 
to conSnuous learning and growth, currently expanding my exper Sse in mul Smodal AI, including Large Language 
Models (LLMs) and Large Vision Models (LVMs). I thrive on crea Sng innovaSve soluSons that contribute to societal 
progress.

March 2024 – July 2024 (5 months)
• Led development of an advanced unsupervised anomaly detecSon system for photovoltaic sensors, 
successfully integrated into Sun-Q Energy Management System (EMS). 
• Implemented state-of-the-art deep learning architectures (LSTM Autoencoder, LSTM-VAE, TranAD) while 
overseeing team development of GNN and USAD models. 
• Built automated data pipeline processing 1.3M+ daily sensor readings, reducing preprocessing Sme from 3 
hours to 15 minutes. 
• Established MLﬂow experimentaSon framework for systemaSc model evaluaSon and opSmizaSon, tracking 
key performance metrics (recall, precision, F1-score)  across mulSple architectures.
